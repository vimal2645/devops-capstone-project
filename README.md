## Usage

You should use this template to start your DevOps Capstone project. It contains all of the code that you will need to get started.

Do Not fork this code! It is meant to be used by pressing the  <span style=color:white;background:green>**Use this Template**</span> button in GitHub. This will copy the code to your own repository with no connection back to the original repository like a fork would. This is what you want.

## Development Environment

These labs are designed to be executed in the IBM Developer Skills Network Cloud IDE with OpenShift. Please use the links provided in the Coursera Capstone project to access the lab environment.

Once you are in the lab environment, you can initialize it with `bin/setup.sh` by sourcing it. (*Note: DO NOT run this program as a bash script. It sets environment variable and so must be sourced*):

```bash
source bin/setup.sh
